I created this VR space using HTML, Javascript, and A-frame.

I then made a floor to start the foundation of the house using the a-entity tag with a box shape.

After getting the foundation to the right size i then made the outside walls. To make these I used the a-entity tag and gave it the box shape with a width, depth, and height. I then made them look more realistic by adding a texture to these walls. 

I then made walls on the inside in order to make rooms inside my house. The same technique was used on these walls as the outerwalls. 

I then began to decorate the house.

The dining table and chairs were made using multiple a-entity tags and a wooden texture applied to them. 

The kitchen cabinets were also made with the a-entity tag with a cabinet texture applied to them. 

The rest of the models are .glft models.
